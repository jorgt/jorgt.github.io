##### SAP Developer

Late 2010 Holcim Australia commenced with a re-implementation its entire IT landscape after separating it from CEMEX, its parent company. At the height of the project we had over 20 SAP developers working on this, which I coordinated. My responsibilities as the only developer in permanent employ included:

- Writing technical specifications
- Developing programs in ABAP, ABAPOO and WebDynpro.
- Modifications such as User exits, BADi implementations, screen enhancement

For the re-implementation project itself, I had some additional tasks such as:

- Tracking and prioritizing incoming specs, track current developments in progress
- Making sure overall quality of code is up to today's standards and representing Holcim's best interest in a contractor dominated environment

*Hogeschool Zuyd, The Netherlands*

In 2005 I graduated with a Bachelor of IT from Hogeschool Zuyd, Maastricht (The Netherlands). The degree included courses in project management, data management and analysis, process design, application design and development. 

## Skills 

I speak several languages:

- Dutch – native
- English – fluent
- German - proficient

## Interests 

I try to divide my spare time equally between a few of my passions: Playing guitar, rock climbing and squash. Next to riding my bicycle on my daily commute, climbing and squash keep me happy and fit. Making music is my main creative outlet and I spent liberal amounts doing all of the above. I am not a couch potato.
